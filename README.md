# SRTLA Receiver Plugin for OBS Studio

A custom, high-performance **SRTLA (SRT Link Aggregation)** Receiver plugin built directly for OBS Studio. This plugin allows OBS to act as a native receiver for bonded SRT streams sent from devices running Belabox, IRL Pro, or other SRTLA-compatible encoders.

## 🚀 Download & Installation (Pre-Compiled Binary)

You can download the pre-compiled version of the plugin directly from this repository:

1. **Download the Zip Package**:
   * Navigate to the **[Install](/Install)** directory in this repository.
   * Download the **[SRTLA_Receiver_Windows.zip](/Install/SRTLA_Receiver_Windows.zip)** archive.
2. **Install the Plugin**:
   * Close OBS Studio.
   * Extract the contents of the zip file directly into your OBS Studio installation folder:
     * Default path: `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\`
     * (This automatically copies `SRTLA_Receiver.dll` into `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\obs-plugins\64bit\`).
3. **Launch OBS** and add a new **SRTLA Receiver** source to your scene!

*Note for Windows users:* If you receive a SmartScreen warning or an error when loading, right-click the `SRTLA_Receiver.dll` file, select **Properties**, and check **Unblock** if it was blocked by Windows as a downloaded file.

## ⚙️ How to Configure OBS Source Settings

When you add a **SRTLA Receiver** source to your scene, you will have three main settings:

1. **SRTLA Bind IP (empty for ANY)**:
   * **Crucial for Multi-NIC / Multi-Homed PCs**: If your streaming PC has multiple network cards (e.g., one connected to the home network/Wi-Fi and one connected to a dedicated cellular router/modem), type the local IP address of the interface receiving the stream (e.g., `192.168.100.49`). 
   * This binds the socket and forces all outbound responses (REG3, ACKs, keep-alives) to go out of that specific network card.
   * If you are testing on your local network/Wi-Fi, leave this **blank** to listen on all interfaces.
2. **SRTLA Listen Port (UDP)**:
   * The UDP port where the external encoder (such as your phone) is sending the stream. Ensure this port matches the UDP port forwarding rule on your router.
3. **Local SRT Port**:
   * The internal port used to bridge the proxy to the OBS Media Source. This is strictly internal (`127.0.0.1`) and **should not** be opened or forwarded in your router.

## 🔌 Network & Port Forwarding Requirements

To ensure external connections from cellular networks function properly, configure the following:

1. **Forward the UDP Listen Port**: Forward the UDP port configured in OBS (e.g. `5000` UDP) on your router to the local IP of your OBS PC.
2. **Docker Port Conflicts**: If you previously used the Docker Belabox portal on port `5000` UDP, you **must stop the Docker container** before running the OBS plugin on port `5000` to prevent address binding conflicts.
3. **Internal Loopback**: The local SRT port (e.g. `4000`/`4006`) is internal-only. Do not forward it.

## 📊 Reopening the Monitor Dock

If you close the **SRTLA Status** tree widget, you can reopen it at any time from the top menu of OBS:
1. Go to **Docks** in the top menu.
2. Check **SRTLA Status** to snap the monitor back into the interface.

## 📦 How to Build All Platform Installers (Windows, macOS, Linux)

If you need installer packages (`.exe`/`.zip` for Windows, `.pkg` for macOS, `.deb` for Linux) that automatically install the files into the correct path of OBS:

### Method A: Build Automatically via GitHub (Recommended)
This repository includes a pre-configured GitHub Actions build workflow. **Autobuilding is disabled on general code pushes** to keep your git push clean. It will only run when you explicitly request it:

1. **Build Manually (Workflow Dispatch)**:
   * Go to your repository on GitHub.
   * Click the **Actions** tab.
   * Select **Push** or **dispatch** workflow on the left.
   * Click **Run workflow** -> Select your branch -> Click the green **Run workflow** button.
   * GitHub will automatically compile the code for Windows, macOS, and Linux in parallel and attach the pre-compiled `.zip`, `.exe`, `.pkg`, and `.deb` installers directly to the completed run for you to download!
2. **Build on Release Tag**:
   * Pushing a tag (e.g. `v1.0.0`) automatically compiles all platform installers and attaches them directly to a **Draft Release** in your repository.

### Method B: Build Locally (Windows Only)
To compile the dll on your local Windows machine:
1. Ensure you have **CMake 3.30+** and **Visual Studio 2022** installed.
2. Open terminal in the project root and run:
   ```powershell
   cmake -B build_x64 -S .
   cmake --build build_x64 --config Release
   ```
   The compiled library will output to `build_x64/Release/SRTLA_Receiver.dll`.
